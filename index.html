                           <p>When analysing the Australian educational landscape, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to socio-educational disadvantage in indigenous students. 
                             Barriers affecting indigenous education can be understood through the lens of the ICSEA score, a ranking given to schools which gives an indication of parents occupation and education, as well as the location of the school. </p>

                 When considering the Australian educational landscape, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to <b>socio-educational disadvantage in indigenous students.</b> Barriers affecting indigneous education can be understood through the lens of the <b>ICSEA score</b>, a ranking given to schools which gives an indication of <b>parents occupation and education, as well as the location of the school.</b> <br>
          </p><p>
By understanding the barriers affecting indigenous education, we can have a more nuanced and informed view of their experiences.
             <br>

To understand the educational experiences of Indigenous students, we can first look at NAPLAN scores to see how, on a surface level,  indigneous and non indigenous students compare.

  So why is remoteness dramatically more damaging to Indigenous students? 
      </h2>

        <p>
        <br>One way we can understand this is by considering their ICSEA score. This is a ranking given to a school which takes into consideration the education and occupation of their student's parents. The score of 1000 is considered average, and either end of the spectrum gives us a unique insight into how advantaged or disadvanged the typical is.  </p>

          <P>
            Here we can see the changes to ICSEA scores based on different degrees of remoteness. It is clear that indigenous students are dramatically more disadvantaged than non indigenous using the ICSEA Scores.
